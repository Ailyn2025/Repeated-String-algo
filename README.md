# Repeated-String-algo
This code solves the Repeated String problem by counting how many times 'a' appears in a string that repeats infinitely up to position n. The code first determines how many full repetitions of the string fit within n characters. Then, it counts the 'a's in one string, multiplies that number by the number of repetitions, and adds the 'a's from any partial string at the end.
